Popular linux distributions with systemd, ttyd and sshd.  Superb for use with Docker üêã

## Overview

Configured with /usr/bin/login to present itself in a fashion similar to a virtual machine.  Terminal access via Web (ttyd) and/or SSH.  Users can be configured through file entries in the /config directory.  See base examples and customise with a volume mount for your own needs.  Without customisation, login credentials are guest/guest and root/root

See the individual branches for sources
